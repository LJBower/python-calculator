- [ ] Create new `subtract` branch
- [ ] Add **`subtract`** function
- [ ] Import function in `__init__.py`
- [ ] Add **subtract** test
- [ ] Commit changes and push to GitHub
- [ ] Make pull request
- [ ] Close issue

## Instructions

###  Create branch

Create a new `subtract` branch from `main` to work in.
### Add subtraction function

Create a new `subtract.py` file in the `pythoncalculator/` directory.

```python
def subtract(x, y):
    return x - y

```

Open the `pythoncalculator/__init__.py` file and add the following line of code:

```python
from .subtract import subtract 
```

### Add subtraction test

Create a new `test_subtract.py` file in the `tests/` directory.

Add the following code and save:

```python
from pythoncalculator import subtract


def test_subtract():
    assert subtract(1, 3) == -2

```

### Commit your changes and push to GitHub

Once you've created your function and test files and added the line to import your function to `pythoncalculator/__init__.py`, commit your changes. 

Use `resolves #{ISSUE_NUMBER_YOU_WERE_ASSIGNED}` in your commit message to automatically close the issue when your pull request is merged.

Then push them up to GitHub

### Create pull request

Finally, create a pull request back to the `main` branch on GitHub and wait for the owner's review.

Reference the issue your pull request refers to with `#{ISSUE_NUMBER_YOU_WERE_ASSIGNED}` in the description. 

Respond to any requests for correction.

### Close issue

If the issue didn't close automatically, close it yourself. You can also
